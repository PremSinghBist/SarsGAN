This codebase features a GAN implementation designed for generating SARS-COV-2 Spike sequences. It has been meticulously customized and fine-tuned to suit specific implementation requirements. The original codebase is credited to Repecka, D., Jauniskis, V., Karpus, L., et al., and can be accessed at the following link: https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-021-00310-5:https://github.com/Biomatter-Designs/ProteinGAN , GitHub Repository. https://github.com/Biomatter-Designs/ProteinGAN

Additionally, the implementation of the SARS-Escape model is available through the collaborative efforts of Prem Singh Bist, Hilal Tayara, and Kil To Chong. This model aids in the prediction of SARS-COV-2 escape variants and can be referenced in the article published in Briefings in Bioinformatics, Volume 24, Issue 3, May 2023, bbad140, accessible at the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbad140 , Prem Singh Bist et al., Briefings in Bioinformatics GitHub Repositor: https://github.com/PremSinghBist/Sars-CoV-2-Escape-Model.git.

For research purposes, all three Escape datasets, including Greany, Baum, and the Validation dataset, are publicly available on Zenodo: Zenodo Dataset.
Furthermore, the newly trained model, enhanced with augmented sequences, are located within the "pretrained" directory for reference and utilization.
